    "text": "The Wolves almost blew this game, eventually coming away with a four-point victory after giving up a big lead during the third quarter. Towns was pivotal once again and continues to step-up in the absence of Jimm Butler (knee). The Wolves travel to Philadelphia to face the 76ers in what should be an entertaining matchup.",
