    "text": "The Nuggets are going to continue to put the ball in Jokic’s hands and trust him to make the right play. We’ve seen examples of that all season, including Sunday. Jokic got the ball for the Christian Laettner-esque turnaround heave. Jokic inbounded the ball to Harris for that game-winner against the Thunder. Jokic might not take the shot at the buzzer every single time, but the Nuggets are still going to run the offense through their best, most versatile player in clutch moments.",
