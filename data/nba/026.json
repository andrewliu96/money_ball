    "text": "That's the fifth 20-20 of his career and this comes on the heels of his career-high of 56 points on Wednesday vs. the Hawks. Things will get a lot tougher on Sunday vs. the Jazz as they are allowing the 10th fewest fantasy points to centers, but Towns is matchup proof and is carrying his fantasy owners to a lot of championships.",
