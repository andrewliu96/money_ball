    "text": "On the one hand, Fultz has transitioned into his new role as Simmons’ 15-minute-a-night backup with surprising ease, bringing a new dimension to the court without disrupting the rhythm the Sixers have developed over the course of this season. They have not lost since Fultz’s return, and rarely have they been outscored when he is on the court.",
