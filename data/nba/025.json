    "text": "Jokic did his part tonight, and then some, but the Nuggets couldn't overcome a balanced attack from the best team in the East. The Joker is rolling right now, averaging 24.6 points, 10.6 rebounds, 5.0 assists, 0.8 steals, 0.6 blocks and 2.6 3-pointers over his last five games. If the Nuggets don't make the playoffs (they're 2.0 games out), it won't be because of a lack of effort from Jokic.",
