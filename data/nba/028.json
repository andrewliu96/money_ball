    "text": "Towns failed to achieve a double-double for the first time in the last six games, but he still found his way to the 20-point mark for the third straight contest. The third-year big simply didn't have as many rebounding opportunities as usual against a hot-shooting Jazz squad and while dealing with Rudy Gobert down low, but he continues to be an elite asset across all formats as the Timberwolves continue to battle for their playoff lives.",
