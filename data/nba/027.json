    "title": "The KAT's Meow: Towns scores career-high 56",
    "text": "Those points set a franchise record for a game to top Mo Williams' 52, and it's just the fourth game over 50 (Kevin Love, Corey Brewer). Towns is also the youngest player since Shaquille O'Neal in 1994 to put up a 50-15 line in a game. At multiple points this season, it was head-scratching to see coach Tom Thibodeau limit KAT's usage, so maybe those days will be few and far between. Additionally, a viral video from last night was flying around the internet with Ben Simmons saying KAT had 'plenty of time' to keep playing PUGB because he was facing the Hawks (video in link below). Towns still hasn't missed a game yet, so he's apparently doing something right with his down time.",
