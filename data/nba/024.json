    "text": "Jokic has been the No. 2 fantasy player over the past month and the Nuggets are making a serious playoff push with just a few games left. They'll host Minnesota on Thursday night and if they win, it could knock the Wolves out of the playoffs and send the Nuggets to the No. 7 seed. And the Pelicans are sandwiched in between the two, making Thursday's game one of the biggest of the season for all involved. And the icing on the cake will be watching the Jokic vs. Karl-Anthony Towns matchup that night, not too mention the potential of a Jimmy Butler return.",
